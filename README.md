# PWNED 3 - Open Source
PWNED (or P3 for short) is an action packed Co-Op RPG on Roblox. Originally created by Swordphin123, epicTT, and vasil12345 as a passion project, it was later accepted into the Roblox Accelerator program.

As a disclaimer, this version of P3 is **not** the current version of P3. This is a relatively stable version of the game prior to December 21st, 2020. Around March 2021, the game underwent a codebase rehaul that sought to improve the workflow of our developers by making it more legible, easier to implement features, and improve debugging workflow. As of November 2021, nothing from this open source repository exists in today's P3.

## Why are we open sourcing PWNED 3?
P3 was originally a passion project meant to improve on the 2011 Roblox classic, PWNED: InCrypt. At the time, a lot of mechanics we were introducing to P3 was quite technologically groundbreaking, but unfortunately this lead to too much prototyping, causing the codebase to be an unorganized mess that made creating features exceptionally difficult. As such, we decided to open source an old version of P3 that helped path the way to our success and to share the mistakes and knowledge we gained over the years.
